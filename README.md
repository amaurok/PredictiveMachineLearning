# Physical Activities Classification

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal 
activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who 
take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are 
tech geeks. 
One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they 
do it.

In this study, we are going to construct a predictive model, in order to predict the manner how the persons did the exercise.
The prediction will be performed with a model trained with a random forest, and using principal components analysis.
